\section{Summary}

GPDs unify the momentum-space parton densities measured in inclusive 
deep-inelastic $eN$ scattering with the spatial densities (form factors) 
measured in elastic scattering.  They describe correlations between the 
momentum and spatial distributions of quarks, which are revealed in 
exclusive processes in $eN$ scattering at large momentum transfer (deeply 
virtual Compton scattering, meson production).

A full program to extract GPDs from measurements requires coverage of a 
large kinematic range in $\xi$, $t$, and $Q^2$, along with measurements of 
several final states together with the use of polarized beam and polarized 
targets (both longitudinal and transverse polarization).  The 12-GeV upgrade 
of the electron accelerator and of the equipment required for the GPD program 
will provide the kinematic coverage needed for a broad program of DVCS and 
meson production measurements.  The JLab 12-GeV upgrade will allow us to map 
the nucleon GPDs in the valence quark region at large $x$, exploring its quark 
structure in unprecedented detail.
