\section{Polarized and unpolarized structure functions}

In this section, we describe our gain in knowledge on polarized and 
unpolarized structure functions that CLAS12 will provide. We discuss
first the large $x$ domain, where JLab offers unique insight, both in
the polarized and unpolarized case. We then illustrate the dramatic
increase in precision on that two months measurements on a longitudinally
polarized NH$_3$ and ND$_3$ target would provide. Integrating
the results will provide moments of structure function, allowing to
study of the transition between partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom,
, higher twist coefficients, the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$, 
and sum rules and related quantities such as polarizabilities.
