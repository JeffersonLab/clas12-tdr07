To extend the BONUS results to higher $x$, a proposal~\cite{BONUS12} for 
35~days of running on gaseous deuterium and 5~days on gaseous hydrogen at 
11~GeV was submitted to JLab PAC30 and conditionally approved.  The experiment 
will use the standard {\tt CLAS12} equipment with the additional recoil 
detector already used in E03-012~\cite{BONUS}.  The anticipated results can be 
seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:b12xpctd} for $F_2^n/F_2^p$ (left) and $u/d$ (right). 
Clearly the $F_2^n/F_2^p$ data obtained using the new method will allow us to 
differentiate unambiguously between different expectations for this ratio.

\caption{\small{Anticipated results on $F_2^n/F_2^p$ (left) and the extracted 
$u/d$ ratio (right) for 40~days of data taking at 11~GeV with {\tt CLAS12}.  
The arrows along the ordinate indicate model predictions.  The error bars 
pertaining to filled circles are statistical with a $W>2$~GeV constraint.  
The smaller errors (with open squares) are for $W>1.8$~GeV.  The systematic 
error is indicated by the band along the abscissa on the left plot.  The two 
curves on the left plot represent hadron-parton duality based predictions 
with two different mechanisms for SU(6) symmetry breaking. The shaded band 
on the right plot indicates our present knowledge on the $d/u$ ratio.}}

JLab PAC30 also approved E12-06-109 \cite{EG12} which will, in particular,
study polarized parton distributions at large $x$. Using standard detection 
equipment, a redesigned polarized target adapted to {\tt CLAS12} and 30 
(50)~days of running on a longitudinally polarized NH$_3$ (ND$_3$) target, 
high precision measurements can be achieved as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:A1xpctd}. 
These data will disentangle models in the large-$x$ region.  While the results 
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:A1xpctd} are with a $W>2$~GeV constraint, hadron-parton 
duality studies (see page \pageref{duality}) will tell us by how much this 
constraint can be relaxed, possibly increasing the $x$ range up to 0.9.  The 
expected accuracy for $(\Delta d+ \Delta\bar{d})/(d+\bar{d})$ is 
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ddodxpctd}.

predict $\Delta d/d$ stays negative (LO and NLO analyses of polarized 
DIS data: GRSV, LSS, AAC, GS, statistical model, and a quark-hadron duality 
scenario) and the ones predicting $\Delta d/d \to 1$ when $x \to 1$ (leading 
order pQCD and a quark-hadron duality scenario).}}
