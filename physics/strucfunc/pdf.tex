\section{Global Fit of Polarized Parton Distributions}

The large window opened by the 12-GeV upgrade over the DIS domain will permit 
constraints of global fits of the parton distributions.  The unique impact at 
large $x$ has just been discussed.  The improvement from the 12-GeV upgrade is 
also significant at low and moderate $x$, noticeably for the polarized gluon 
distribution $\Delta G$.  For a more complete picture of the precision 
achievable with the expected {\tt CLAS12} data, we have plotted in 
Fig.~\ref{pPDFs_exp} an analysis of the impact on NLO analyses.  A dramatic 
improvement can be achieved with the expected data from the {\tt CLAS12} 
proposal E12-06-109~\cite{EG12}.  We emphasize that the data will not only 
reduce the error band on $\Delta G$, but will likely allow a more detailed 
modeling of its $x$-dependence.
