\begin{abstract}
The Central Time Of Flight detector ({\tt CTOF}) 
is being designed at JLab with the  
ordinary  PMTs  requiring a robust magnetic shield from the  main
5~T solenoid fringe fields of 500-1000~G. 
Theoretical consideration of a  ferromagnetic cylinder in axial field  
has demonstrated  that its  shielding capacity  decrease  with  increasing length,
 i.e. long cylinder does not work efficiently. This observation
has been confirmed with Final Element Analysis using  POISSON models.
 Several shields  composed of  coaxial cylinders has been studied.
All  difficulties caused by  saturation effects  were overcame with 
a novel dynamical shield, which utilize  compensating solenoids between shielding cylinders.
Basic dynamical shields for ordinary  and metal channel PMTs were  
designed. Their performances were tested both in models and  experimentally, 
at different external fields and compensating currents. Thus designed  
shields meet the performance requirements.

\section{Introduction.}
The Central Time Of Flight detector ({\tt CTOF}) is being designed at JLab with 
the  best timing PMTs coupled
to the scintillators via  focusing  light guides made of acrylic rods.
Conventional 
R2083 or metal channel H8500 PMTs will be used due to their perfect timing 
characteristics\footnote{We anticipate that regular PMTs
may be replaced with much slower (rise time of 3~ns) fine mesh PMTs 
which may operate at 5000-8000~G without shielding.}. 
Both PMTs  exhibit the  transition time spread of 370~ps and  the   
rise time of 0.7~ns, which is close to the rise time of fast scintillators.  
}
The layout of PMTs,  focusing light guides and scintillators  is shown 
in Fig.~{\ref{barrel2}}. The  corresponding field map of the  solenoid with 
indicated  locations of PMTs is shown in  Fig.~\ref{fig:mmap1}.
%
The nominal field of the solenoid  is 5T, therefore 
a very long, straight  or bent, light guides  are used  for  
delivering light to an area outside of the  solenoid where 
associated fields are of 500-1000~G. 
Since neither of timing PMTs can operate 
at that high fields a  robust magnetic shields are included into the design. 
With this design  we are aiming at the time-of-flight resolution of 
$50-60ps$ using  a double-sided readout.

%
In the following sections  we report on our $R\&D$ for the {\tt CTOF} magnetic shields.
The Final Element Analysis (FEA) and    simulations of shield performance
with POISSON program  has been used for 
design goals.  Doing so, we have  
designed the magnetic shields for both R2083 and H8500 PMTs.
As a further step  we  plan to  measure the maximum tolerating  fields for thus 
designed shields with 5T solenoid.  We hope that  with a robust  shielding both PMT  models 
may operate at significantly higher fields. Therefore,  a  shorter light guides may  be implemented,
that   improves  the  time resolution.
%
%This will allow us to  optimize  the length of 
%light guides for  a  better time resolution.



\section{Design constrains and shield dimensions.}

\paragraph{External field.}
The  field map of the main Solenoid is shown in  Fig.~\ref{fig:mmap1}, as well as  the 
locations of PMT photo cathodes, indicated with cross-hairs.
%It is seen  from this figure that 
The   upstream and downstream light guides  are  1.4m and 1.6m long, respectively.   
The corresponding values of magnetic  field in the vicinity of the photo cathodes  
are of $\leq 250$G and $\leq 500$G. 
For  redundancy  we double the design specifications for  maximum sustainable    field.
\paragraph{PMT inner field.}
Our basic  PMT is  R2083 from Hamamatsu which
has a  shortest rise time 0.7~ns  and   quite low transition time spread (TTS) of 370ps.
The diameter of its  photo cathode  is $46mm$. 

As most of timing PMTs it has a spherical photo cathode. 
Such shape is helpful to  equalize travel  distances of primary photo electrons. 
Due to a spherical shape of the photo cathode, at any orientation of PMT relative to external
magnetic field, the accelerating  electrical field has  a  component perpendicular to  a magnetic field.
Therefore, timing PMTs  are more  sensitive to fringe  magnetic fields.

The design of R2083  is similar   to XP4312
with the photo cathode  $76mm$ in diameter. Therefore, XP4312  is more sensitive to magnetic 
fields. This PMT  was sorrows studied as a candidate to the CLAS TOF detectors by J.Flint
and E.Smith in 1993. It was shown that it    
manifests  an  additional time smearing of $\leq30ps$  at magnetic fields 
of  $0.2-0.4G$\footnote{See a corresponding field map in Fig.13 of  CLAS Note 94-008}.
Since our main PMT is similar in design we can admit these values as
 maximum susceptible field at the photo cathode\footnote{The   optional metal channel PMTs H8500 has a similar  
rise time, but it  may operate at 200-500~G  without magnetic shielding.}.
 However, we aim to lower fields of $\leq0.1G$, for redundancy.
%It will be clear from the further consideration  that in the 3 layer shielding with a thin
%high permeability inner layer, the field at the photo cathode may be reduced to practical zero.

%  $\approx 30/300~mT$ respectively is  required.
%However, we anticipate that  at
% the final stage of designing  the regular PMTs may be replaced
%with fine mesh PMTs, which are insensitive to magnetic fields up to 700mT.
%  Due to their  different sense areas($S_a$) and
%tolerated magnetic fields $(B_m)$ the corresponding
%light guides has various  transmission lengths($L_t$) and diameters.
%The time being we consider %, as the most realistic candidates,
%the following PMTs\footnote{Unfortunately, recently
% Hamamatsu has discontinued   the most appropriate
%fine mesh PMT R6504 with the photo cathode diameter $51mm$}:
%However, the more efficient is the shield
%the shorter may be light guides, thus the better may be  the time resolution.
%The main  goal of this note is to
% estimate  a  possible shield's   dimensions and  tolerated fields
%using  simple methods suggested by different manufacturers of magnetic shields.
\paragraph{Shield diameter.}
Under the current design of the {\tt CTOF}, shown in Fig.\ref{barrel2},
both the downstream and upstream PMTs are arranged in a 
circular patterns while  the corresponding light guides forms a  kind of ``wigwam''. 
Such design constrains the radial coordinate $r_{50}$  of 50 adjacent  shields. 
Thus, the most critical shield  parameter, its diameter $D_{sm}$,  
is also constrained
\footnote{To avoid this constrain a more complex design with a  radial 
stagger may be used at the upstream side.}:
%
\begin{equation}
%D_{sm}=2\frac{r_{50}}{(ctg(3.6^o)-1)} =134.277\times r_{50}.
D_{sm}=2\frac{r_{50}}{sin(3.6^o)} =134.27\times r_{50}.
\label{eq776}
\end{equation}

%
According to this table, the upstream R2083 shield has to withstand 
against
\footnote{For ordinary PMTs we double the tolerating field, for redundancy} 
of $\leq 500G$, provided the light guide length is $1400mm$. 
In such case the diameter of the magnetic shield has to be below $86mm$.

The downstream R2083 meets a significantly higher  magnetic  field.
Provided the  length of  light guides  is 1600mm, the maximum field would
be $\leq 1000G$. Thus, the downstream  shield may be as thick as   $146mm$.
Most likely  R2083 PMTs will be used in the assembly H2431, in which R2083 is 
enclosed into the $\mu$-metal shielding. The sizes of this shield are
$0.8mm$ thick, $60mm$ in external diameter and $200mm$ long.
We plan to ask Hamamatsu to increase  the  length  in order to provide  a overhung 
of $30-60mm$ from  the photo cathode side as it is required for a 
efficient shielding of the photo cathode\footnote{The internal field 
drops significantly at the depth of one radius of the shield.}.

\section{ Principles of shield performance and design.}

The   PMT shield may be active or passive.
Active shielding makes use of  magnetic fields produced by a  solenoids  around a PMT to
cancel the internal  field. We do not plan to use active shielding
because, firstly,  in our case the  interfering  fringe  filed
is  not solenoidal, secondly,  such shield  will be  complex and costly,
thirdly, it may be a source of  electronic pickup.

In a passive shielding  the diamagnetic properties
of superconducting cylinder could be  used to block the magnetic field  inside a shield.
Such  kind of shielding looks very complex and expensive, since it requires cryogenic equipments.

We plan to study the  traditional approach  based on the  properties of 
ferromagnetic cylinders.
In such shield, magnetic field lines are concentrated in the bulk of a
ferromagnetic, reducing the fringing fields inside the cylinder.
However, its effectiveness  in high magnetic fields is limited by the
maximum possible magnetisation of  the  ferromagnetic.
This is a so called  saturating field, 
which  is the most critical parameter, affecting shield performance.


%
%Unfortunately, the ferromagnetic shield around PMTs
%need holes in both ends.
%These holes allow the shield to be slid onto the PMT,
%Active shielding makes use of the magnetic field
%produced by a  coil to cancel the
%fringing magnetic field in the PMT's area.
%Active shielding may be  relatively light weight,
% compared to ferromagnetic shielding.
%
%\subsection{Ferromagnetic shielding.}
\subsection{Qualitative consideration of  shield performance.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\paragraph{Practical formulas.}
\paragraph{Transverse fields.}
The problem of the  infinite  hollow ferromagnetic cylinders in the uniform
transverse magnetic fields has been  solved analytically\footnote{See the  Gluex-doc-843 Jul-17 by E.Smith}, as well as the
 problem  for ellipsoids in axial fields.  Therefore,  the following formulas
\footnote{Recommended by  the Magnetic Shield
 Corporation.}
%{\verb |http://www.magnetic-shield.com/dynamics/works.html|}}
 are available for estimating  the magnetic shield parameters:
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{B_o}{B_{in}}\approx \mu({B_m})\frac{t}{D_+}~~~;~~~B_m\approx B_o\frac{D_+}{0.8t}~~~;~~~t\approx B_o\frac{D_+}{0.8B_m}
\label{eq000}
\end{equation}
where $S$ stands for the shielding factor of a cylinder,
$\mu(B_m)$ - the permeability in function  on the field in the shielding material $B_m$,
$B_o$ - the external  field, 
$B_{in}$ - the field inside ferromagnetic,
$D_+$ - the external diameter of the cylinder and
$t=D_+-D_-$ - the thickness of a shielding material, where $D_-$ 
is the internal diameter. 
For a multilayer shielding of $n$ coaxial cylinders, separated by $\approx 1mm$ by radius,
the resulting shielding factor is:
%
\begin{equation}
S=S_1 \times S_2 \times...\times S_n
\label{eq777}
\end{equation}
%
where $S_i,i=1,...,n$ are shielding factors for
$i$-cylinder,  estimated via Eq.\ref{eq000}.
\paragraph{Axial fields.}
Although the above formulas are recommended  for rough estimations
in perpendicular fields they may be also used in case of  
axial field, provided the
cylinder lengths exceeds  four  diameters.



Let's consider a simple  model for a PMT  magnetic shield, 
i.e. a ferromagnetic ($\mu>>1$) cylinder of outer   diameters $D_+$ , inner diameter $D_-$ , the corresponding 
thickness $t=\frac{1}{2}(D_+-D_-)$ and finite length $L\approx 4D_+$.  Assume that the cylinder is  
placed into a uniform axial  field $B_o$ created
inside an infinitely long thin  solenoid of  diameter  $2D_+$.
Magnetic flux conservation in the median plane of  such system implicates:
\begin{equation}
4B_o \pi D_+^2 \approx 4B_{in} \pi D_+^2 + (B_m-B_{in}) \pi (D_+^2-D_-^2),
\label{eq004}
\end{equation}
where  $B_m$ is the  field in the ferromagnetic media, $B_{in}$ - the field  inside  the shielding cylinder.
Neglecting $B_{in}$ compared $B_o$ one can relate   the field in the media, $B_m$, to the field inside the 
shielding, $B_{in}$, as follows:
 \begin{equation}
B_m  \approx B_0\frac{D+}{t}=\mu B_{in}~~~;~~~B_{in}= B_0\frac{D+}{t\mu},
\label{eq003}
\end{equation}
where the permeability $\mu$  has to be determined  from the ferromagnetic  magnetization curve $B(H)$ at
the  magnetic flux density  $B_m$. 
These formulas  are  in agreement to the practical  formulas in Eq.\ref{eq000}.


%Hence,  our shielding  will be composed of 2-3  coaxial
%cylinders,  fabricated from different  ferromagnetic  materials.




\subsection{Ferromagnetic materials.}
Available ferro-magnetics come in two types: those with high saturation and
those with high permeability.
%, in other words,
%there is always trade-off.
High permeability materials are useful  in small  fields.
Therefore,  high permeability materials has been  used to ``wrap '' PMTs.  
One of such materials is Co-Netic, which contains 80.6\% Ni and 14\% Fe and is in the 
same family metallurgically as Mu-metal. 
%Conetic may be  used for the inner  shield layer around PMTs.
 
In high fields  the  materials with high saturation should be used
since a low saturation material would need to be excessively thick.
The   silicon steel (2.25\% Si, 0.40\% Al, balance Fe) may be implemented as 
external shielding. It has been  widely used  in  industry for relays and motors.
%specifically Allegheny Ludlum Relay Steel #5.
%The composition of silicon steel is 2.25\% Si, 0.40\% Al, balance Fe
It  is easy to form and  has moderately high saturation  $1.56/1.96T$
\footnote{For a  non-oriented/oriented grain makes, respectively}.
The more advanced and expensive  Netic alloy saturates at $2.14T$.

In  moderate fields after the external layer of shielding another  higher
permeability material Hiperm-49 may be used as intermediate layer.

The magnetisation curves for Netic and Co-Netic are given in Fig.~\ref{muneco}.
and  in Fig.~\ref{hiperm49} for Hiperm-49.

\subsection{Preliminary estimations of shielding factor.}
For a qualitative  evaluation of  
shield design  and performance  we  use the  
Eq.\ref{eq000}.
The reference   design  of the  R2083 shield is shown in Fig.\ref{VBT3CY}.
A detailed FEA calculations will be  reported in the following  Section-\ref{FEA}.

\label{VBT3CY}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Shielding factor}
The procedure of estimation is as follows.
Initially we set the  external magnetic field $B_o$ to be 
tolerated by the shield.
First we estimate the field inside the ferromagnetic $B_m$.
Then  we read the value of $\mu(B_m)$ from the Fig.~\ref{muneco}.
Then  we  determine the magnetic field inside the shield, $B_{in}$.
This  procedure will be repeated recursively starting from the outer layer 
with  $B_o=B_{in}$ from the previous step.

The stages  of   such estimation are listed in Table~\ref{ca001}.
In this table  the initial external field was  set $3000~G$.
Although the field inside the ferromagnetic $(B_m)$ is close to saturation,
the internal field $(B_{in})$ after the first layer  is only $27.4~G$. 
In such low field the permeability of the second layer of the same ferromagnetic 
is 3300, that results in $0.4~G$ field inside the second layer. 
Unexpectedly these rough  estimates  are in qualitative   agreement to the FEA
calculations ($0.23~G$) performed for us by the Mu-shield company (see Fig.~\ref{shieldGrilli}).

Two shield  configurations for the H8500 metal channel PMT are evaluated 
 in Table~\ref{H8500at17600}.
Depending on the  magnetic flux density in the  ferromagnetic,
the external shield diameter may vary from  124~mm to 128~mm.  
In further  FEA simulation, described in Section~\ref{FEA},
 shield diameter  was  optimized to  110-120~mm.

In Table~\ref{cal2} we evaluate several 2-3 layer  shields 
at 3000, 2000, 1000 and 500~G. As seen form  this table,  
the outer cylinder makes the major part of work. 
After it reduce the external field  to $10-20G$ the rest of work may  
be easily done  by a high permeability
cylinder, such as E989-05, which is the standard R2083 shielding in the H2431 
assembly. In combination with Netic cylinder, 115~mm in diameter,  it may 
reduce the $3000~G$ field to practical zero.

%Of course,  FEA simulations and optimization  in inhomogeneous magnetic field 
%has to be performed.

%Another sample of magnetic shield dynamics  is listed  in Table~\ref{htcc} for the
%HTCC detector. The nominal design includes 3
% layers of ferromagnetic. According to this table 
%fields below  $0.01G$ may be achieved with only two layers of Netic and Conetic.
%

%In the current  {\tt CTOF} design there
%is  enough space for such  wide shield, it is very likely that a three  
%layer shielding $\approx120$mm in diameter and $15-20~mm$ thick will be sufficient. 
%Perhaps, the light guides may be shorter $\approx 120cm$ long, only.
From this simplified consideration we conclude the following.
%we conclude that 
Since in the  the length of each shielding cylinder
will be  compatible to its diameter, we expect 3-4 times reduced  
shield capacity in terms of external field.
Hence, our shield will  have  at least three layers.
The   diameter of the external thick cylinder may  range within  
$110-130~mm$ while its thickens may  be $15-20~mm$.
 
In  the following Section-\ref{ednmics} we study  the electrodynamics of  
ferromagnetic cylinders  in axial field. From this theoretical 
consideration  we learn that shielding dynamics  is very  different from 
the transverse case and that longitudinal dimensions are of a crucial importance. 
Therefore, a detailed FEA calculations with several 
shield  models were performed and we discuss these studies in Section-\ref{FEA}.

\section{Electrodynamics of   magnetic shields  and Final Element Analysis.}
\label{ednmics}
%The most powerfull Final Element Analysis
Final Element Analysis   of  shield models   in external field  is the most appropriate method for shield developing.
However, an unambiguous interpretation of  FEA results for complex  models  is impossible without clear  conception on  the     
%be  helpful to consider   the 
electro-dynamics of ferromagnetic  cylinder in axial fields.

Ferromagnetic properties of materials may be reproduced assuming that  its  
inner space is filled with  randomly oriented  dipoles, or current loops, responsible for 
a local  magnetization. The external  field  just aligns internal  current loops along 
field  direction. As a result, inner   fields  are amplified  by  
orders of magnitude. However,  outside the ferromagnetic the resulting field  
drops, since   in this region the  common  field of  current loops  
is opposite to the original  field. 
%Starting from  this  point one may forget about the ferromagnetic media.  
%It is   replaces  now with  a field of current loops in vacuum. 
That's the basic mechanism of magnetic shielding.


\subsection{Ferromgantic cylinder in axial field.}
Effectively, only surface currents protect the inner space of a shielding cylinder, since 
internal  currents cancel each other in the bulk of the ferromagnetic.
Due to a cylindrical symmetry, the surface  currents  run in $\phi$-directions,
in which connection  currents over the inner surface of a cylinder
will be opposite to that of  outer surface. Therefore, our shield  
may be approximated by two  thin coaxial solenoids with opposite currents.
The outer solenoid has the diameter $D_+$, while the inner diameter is
$D_-=D_+-t$, where $t$ is the thickness of the original ferromagnetic cylinder.
%Starting from  this  point one may forget about the ferromagnetic media.  
%It is   replaces  now with  a field of current loops in vacuum.

According  to a  known formula for a field  of a  finite  solenoid, the magnetic field   $B_+(z)$ 
at the axis $z$, induced by the outer surface of our shield  yields:
%
\begin{equation}
 B_{+}(z)=+\mu_o j_s(Cos~\alpha^+(z)-Cos~\beta^+(z)~)
\label{eq31}
\end{equation}
%
where 
$j_s$ is the absolute value of surface current density,
$\alpha_^+(z)$ and $\beta_^+(z)$ are  the two  angles between 
$z$-axis and two  vectors between   point $z$ and corresponding 
butts of a cylinder.
Due to  opposite direction of  the inner currents the corresponding field is also 
opposite:
%
\begin{equation}
%B_-=-\mu_o j_s \frac{L}{\sqrt{L^2+D_-^2}}
B_-(z)=-\mu_o j_s(Cos~\alpha^-(z) - Cos~\beta^-(z)~)
\label{eq32}
\end{equation}
%
Thus, the resulting vacuum field inside the shield, $B_{in}$ , may be evaluated as
%
\begin{equation}
%B_{in}(z)=B_o + B_+ - B_-\approx B_o-\mu_o j_s \frac{t}{L}
B_{in}-B_o = B_+ - B_-
\approx - \mu_o j_s
\small{(Sin(\frac{\alpha^++\alpha^-}{2})(\alpha^+-\alpha^-)
-Sin(\frac{\beta^++\beta^-}{2})(\beta^+-\beta^-))}
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
%
%where  factor
%$g(z)\approx 2(Sin^2(\alpha_1)Cos(\alpha_1)-Sin^2(\alpha_2)Cos(\alpha_2))$%
%$g(z)\approx
% Sin(\frac{\alpha^+ + \alpha^-}{2})(\alpha^+-\alpha^-)
%-Sin(\frac{ \beta^+ +  \beta^-}{2})( \beta^+- \beta^-)$.
From this equation we make an unexpected  observation
that at infinitely increasing length  $B_{in}->B_o$, 
since all angles direct at zero.
In other words, a very long shield  does  not work. 
This conclusion contrast with   the traditional logic implicated by a well known 
dynamics of shields in  transverse fields. 

Let us now estimate the filed in the center of the ferromagnetic cylinder($z=0$).
Evaluating the trigonometrical functions in  Eq.~\ref{eq1} and assuming  $t<<D$
we find:
%
\begin{equation}
%B_{in}(z)=B_o + B_+ - B_-\approx B_o-\mu_o j_s \frac{t}{L}
B_{in}-B_o = B_+ - B_- \approx - \mu_o j_s  \frac{t}{D} \frac{4x^2} {(1+x^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}
= - \mu_o j_s \frac{t}{D} g(x)
\label{eq101}
\end{equation}
where we define  $g(x)$ in  function of  $x=\frac{D}{L}$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the Eq.~\ref{eq101} the inner field $B_{in}$
links to the  ferromagnetic properties 
via surface current density  $j_s$. With this 
relation we note that in  the Maxwell equation
\begin{equation}
rot~\textbf{H} = \textbf{j} ~
\label{eqHJ}
\end{equation}
$\textbf{j}$ %=$\textbf{j_{ext}}$+$\textbf{j_s}$
is the sum of external-$\textbf{j}_e$-  and
surface   currents -$\textbf{j}_s$.
Integrating Eq.\ref{eqHJ} over a rectangular loop, enclosing the inner surface element 
in the $middle$ of the solenoid, we find\footnote{Radial components are canceled due to the mirror symmetry.}:
%
\begin{equation}
                  H_m^z =H_{is}^z+j_s
\label{eqBJ1}
\end{equation}
%
where $H_m^z$ is   z-component  in the bulk of   ferromagnetic,
$H_{in}^z$ is the field at the  axis, 
%close proximity to the
%inner surface of the shield 
$j_s$ is the $\phi$ component of the surface current density.
Thus,  we obtain the following  relation:
%
\begin{equation}
B_m = B_{in}+\mu_o j_s=\mu(B_m)B_{in}   %%%\approx \mu(B_m)\kappa B_{in}
\label{eqBJ}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mu(B_m)>>1$ is the corresponding permeability  of a  ferromagnetic.
Using  Eq.\ref{eqBJ}  to exclude  the term  %$\mu_o \j_s$ 
$\mu_o j_s$ from the Eq.\ref{eq101} we find:
%
\begin{equation}
B_{in}\approx B_o - \mu(B_m)  \frac{g(x)t}{D}  B_{in}
\label{eq11}
\end{equation}
%
Then we find:
%
\begin{equation}
B_{o}\approx
\mu(B_m)\frac{g(x)t}{D} B_{in}=
\frac{g(x)t}{D}B_{m}~~~, ~~ => ~~~B_{m}=B_o\frac{D}{g(x)t}
\label{eq12}
\end{equation}
%
The final relation between external and internal fields is given by
%
\begin{equation}
B_o \approx \mu\bigg(B_o 
\frac{D}{g(x)t}\bigg) \frac{g(x)t }{D} B_{in}=S \times B_{in} ,
\label{eqfinal}
\end{equation}
%
where $S$ stands for a shielding factor.
Note that  the function
%
\begin{equation}
 g(x)=\frac{4x^2}{(1+x^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}},
\label{sf01}
\end{equation}
%where  $x=\frac{D}{L}$,
%  Function $g(x)$ 
has a maximum at $x=\sqrt2$. Therefore, one may  expect the maximum of shield
effectiveness at $D \approx \sqrt2L$.  We have verified this prediction  with 
FEA calculations in Section-\ref{FEA}.


An important practical advice may be ruled out   from   Eq.\ref{eqBJ}.
% which
% relates the internal ferromagnetic field to the surface currents.
Assume  that  a  tiny piece of ferromagnetic, a probe, is in close contact to the inner
surface of our  ferromagnetic cylinder.  External field induce 
corresponding surface currents in both materials.
In  case of close contact  the  surface currents must  be  identical, 
otherwise   would  contradict  to the charge  conservation law. Therefore,  
the  magnetization of the probe must  be  equal to that of the  
ferromagnetic layer.
Thus, we  conclude  that  in order to provide  independent performance of 
different coaxial layers according to Eq.\ref{eq777}, contacts between  
layers must  be avoided.

\subsection{Gradient forces}
In this paragraph we estimate the effect of a magnetic field gradients.
Due to a significant non-uniformity's  of magnetic fields in the PMT area,
the magnetic shield anticipates a  force \textbf{F}, caused
by  gradients of the magnetic field energy density:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{F}=grad_rW(r) = grad_r \int d^3 \textbf{x}
\frac
{ \textbf{B_m}^2({\textbf{x}+\textbf{r}})  }
{ 2\mu_{o}\mu( {\textbf{x}+\textbf{r}}  )  },
\label{eq024}
\end{equation}
where  integration has to be  done over  internal coordinates of
ferromagnetic(\textbf{x}), \textbf{r}- stands for external coordinates
of ferromagnetic shield, $B_m$ - is the magnetic flux density inside the
ferromagnetic.
%
Taking into account the  relations from Eq.\ref{eq000},
one can estimate the upper limit of  the integral from Eq.\ref{eq024} as 
%
\begin{equation}
{F_{max}= \frac{\pi l D^3}{t\mu_{o}\mu_{min}}
B_{o}^{max} ( \frac {dB_o} {dx})_{max}}~~~~~~~~~~~
\label{eq034}
\end{equation}
where 
$B_o^{max}\approx0.3~T$ - maximum  possible external field  in the shield area,
$(\frac{dB_o}{dx})_{max}\approx0.1~T\times(0.05~m)^{-1}=2~Tm^{-1}$ -   maximum 
possible gradient of external field, according to the  field map in the shield  area,
$\mu_{min}\approx250$ -   minimum possible permeability
from Table~\ref{cal2},
 $l=0.3m, t=0.025m, D=0.12m$ - length,  thickness
and diameter of the ferromagnetic cylinder,
$\mu_o = 4\pi 10^{-7}N·A^{-2}$  -  permeability of vacuum.
Using these numbers  we find:
%
\begin{equation}
F_{max}= \frac{\pi \cdot 0.3 \cdot m
\cdot (0.12 \cdot m)^3 }{0.025\cdot m \cdot
4 \pi 10^{-7}\cdot N \cdot A^{-2} \cdot 600} \cdot
0.3 \cdot T \cdot 2 \cdot T\cdot m^{-1}= 124.4 \cdot N
\label{eq035}
\end{equation}
%$\mu_o = 4\pi 10^{-7} N·A^{-2}$.
Thus,  the maximum attractive   force
%, which may attract the ferromagnetic 
%shielding to the solenoid,
does not exceed the  shield  weight.
We plan  to  address  gradient forces in future   FEA simulation.




\subsection{Final Element Analysis~(FEA) of coaxial cylinders.}
\label{FEA}

In the following  sections we describe our  FEA studies of coaxial ferromagnetic cylinders.
Our goal is to develop a  robust
magnetic shields for both  R2083 and H8500 PMTs. 
In our  studies we aim at inner PMT fields  of $0.1~G$ and $200~G$ for the ordinary R2083 and
metal channel  H8500, respectively.   We also  verify the predictions of our 
simplified theory, which was found to be successful in  interpretations of sometimes surprising FEA results.

With this purpose in mind, a magnetic field maps have  been calculated
inside  various magnetic shields at varying  external fields.
Field map inside different  shields has been  obtained with 
the POISSON-Superfish  program,  which performs two-dimensional net calculations 
in  limited space.  This program  simulates an axial symmetric 
field map in the free space of a  model and in the 
bulk of a ferro-magnetic, as well.  External  field of required magnitude  has been
created by a thin solenoid with  the sizes  larger of the model.
The boundary conditions enforced  the field lines to be parallel to the borders.
Thus, one may  consider  both the  shield and the  solenoid as 
confined   inside  a   large diamagnetic box.
 
%In our further studies we aim at inner PMT fields  of $0.1~G$ and $200~G$ for the ordinary R2083 and
%metal channel  H8500, respectively.
%Such  shields will allow us to reduce the 
%length of light guides below $\approx 1.4m$ in the  design with R2083.
%In case of H8500 the length may be reduced to $\approx 0.9m$.
% This could result in  a   substentialy improved time resolution of the detector.
%
%In addition such calculations may be  important for the designing
%of the main Solenoid, since the expected total weight of PMT shielding ~1 metric 
%tonn is compartible to the total mass of a possible return yoke.





\section{Single Layer Shield for H8500.}
The metal channel Hamamatsu H8500 PMT has been 
considered due to its ability to operate in magnetic fields up to 200~G.
Thus, the shielding factor may be as low as 10-20 in order to tolerate
 fields of $2000-2500$G. Therefore, this shield may be a  single  ferromagnetic cylinder.  
This simple shield  was  the first candidate to be analyzed  with POISSON and  it
was  tested for some predictions of the  theory described in  Section-\ref{ednmics}.

Various potential solutions for the H8500 magnetic shielding for both  
downstream and upstream PMTs were also tested.
After  the POISSON calculations several  records of  magnetic field values were taken 
at specific  points: 
(1)- at the surface of the photo-cathode with  coordinates  (5,5) and (5,30),
(2)- at the entry to the inner space -(30,5) and (30,30), 
(3)-inside the ferromagnetic - (5,40) and (30,40). 
The last two points (5,40) and (30,40) has been used 
 to control the saturation effects in the  ferromagnetic. All points are given in 
(r,z) form in mm.

\subsection{Upstream Shield  and  effects of  shield dimensions.}
\label{emsdimen}
POISSON calculations were used to verify the predictions of our 
simplified theory developed in Section-\ref{ednmics}.
That was an important step in understanding the shield performance, 
which was surprising in many cases.
The  unexpected prediction of this  simple theory yields  from  
Eq.~\ref{eqfinal}, which  relates the shield
effectiveness to the dimensions of a ferromagnetic cylinder. 
Due to this formula,  at constant permeability, the shield effectiveness has a
maximum at $D =\sqrt{2}\times L$.  Therefore,  unlimited increasing of  
the shield   lengths  at given diameter results in  ``collapse'' 
 of shield performance.

In order to verify this prediction
the dependence of the shield effectiveness upon its length at a constant diameter 
86~mm was tested with POISSON.  The  corresponding test  shield is 
shown in Fig.~\ref{Upstream_PMT_Design}. This  shield is not a 
perfect cylinder. The curvature on the front of the shield provided more uniform 
filed across the ferromagnetic.
Therefore,  the internal magnetic field is also more uniform
\footnote{Ideally, the shield would
be an ellipse, but due to spacing required for the light guide to
be placed partly inside the shielded region to reach the PMT, 
this is not possible.}.

%
The calculated  shield  effectiveness  in function on shield length is shown in
Fig.~\ref{Upstream_Iron_6mm_PMT_Region}. It is  seen from this figure,
that there is a pronounced minimum 
%in the central  magnetic field 
at $50-60$~mm which agrees   
to the prediction. This helps to confirm both  the Eq.~\ref{eqfinal} and the model, 
and is certainly cause for further study, as well as aiding in the 
designing of the {\tt CTOF} Shields. 
%It also helps to avoid some   confusions 
%in negotiations with manufacturers.

Using higher saturation NETIC provided some  better  performance over the use of iron
and NETIC was thus tested in place
of the iron, as shown in Fig.~\ref{Upstream_NETIC_6mm_PMT_Region}.

Due to the higher permeability of NETIC compared to the soft iron all test points 
within the PMT region are well below the 200 G toleration.
% This is due to the higher permeability of NETIC compared to the soft iron.

\subsection{Upstream Shield performance at high external  fields.}
The upstream PMT shielding has much more restrictive specifications based 
upon the current design, allowing for a shield diameter no wider than 86~mm for both types of PMTs.
To meet these specifications, the thickness of the shield shown in Fig.~\ref{Upstream_PMT_Design} 
was reduced to 4~mm.
This shield was tested using both iron and Netic. 
As seen in Fig.~\ref{Upstream_Iron_4mm_PMT_Region}  and Fig.~\ref{Upstream_NETIC_4mm_PMT_Region} 
respectively yet neither of them  were capable of reaching the 1000~G safety buffer. 
However, the iron shield reached the 200~G tolerance at approximately 
750~G while the Netic shield crossed it at 800~G. Both values are acceptable.

\end{figure}
%
Thus, the limitations by the current design, 
that permit a shield no thicker than 4~mm, is not  too restrictive for the expected 
external magnetic field of 800~G.



\subsection{Downstream Shielding in high  external fields.}

The downstream H8500 PMT may be required to operate at significantly 
higher fields of $2000$G or higher.  Such fields may be tolerated with  a single  soft 
iron cylinder 21~mm thick. The design and a field map sample are  shown on 
Fig.~\ref{Single_Iron_21mm_Shield}. 
As seen from further analysis, shown in  Fig.~\ref{Single_Iron_21mm_PMT_Region},
this design  will sufficiently protect the H8500 up to an external field of 2500~G.  

Similar shields of both iron and
NETIC 31~mm thick  were tested, but neither gave substantial increase in 
performance. When tested at a thickness of 11~mm, a single shield of iron
permitted the PMT to operate up to 1750~G, that is  not acceptable, 
whereas the NETIC shield of equal thickness was within acceptable limits up to 2000~G.

It should be also  noted that several shield configurations were additionally tested:
(1) two-layer shield with two layers of iron,(2) a layer of Netic over a layer of Co-Netic, and 
(3) an iron-Netic combination was also tested, but the results were not 
comparable to the 21~mm thick single iron or NETIC shield.

%
For comparison, the same shield using NETIC instead of iron results in more robust
behavior shown in Figs.~\ref{Single_NETIC_21mm_PMT_Region}
and \ref{Single_NETIC_21mm_Shield_Region}.
According to these figures  a single NETIC shield of equal thickness 
allows the PMT to operate in a higher magnetic fields up to  2600~G.

%As seen in Fig.~\ref{Single_NETIC_21mm_PMT_Region}, the 
Thus, NETIC shield presents little difference
in performance. In terms of cost, weight, and ease of manufacturing, 
the iron shield is a much more viable selection for the downstream PMT shielding. 
Therefore, an iron shield at a thickness
of 21~mm, an inner radius of 32~mm and an outer radius of 65~mm will be 
considered for use as 
the shield for the downstream H8500 PMT.

\subsection{Proposed PMT Shielding  in use with the H8500.}%%

\paragraph{Upstream shield}
If the CTOF design is modified to allow 
the upstream PMTs to be aligned in a staggered configuration, 
it will provide an additional few mm of shielding. 
This modification will allow the upstream H8500 to operate well at
1000~G external field. 

The proposed design
is shown  in Fig.~\ref{Upstream_PMT_Design}. This  shield has
a thickness of 6~mm, with an inner diameter of 76~mm and an outer 
diameter of 88~mm to the horizontal. This shield  was tested 
in Section-\ref{emsdimen} using both iron and NETIC at a constant
external magnetic field of 1000~G and varying lengths.

\paragraph{Downstream shield}
The proposed shield for  downstream PMTs is shown in
Fig.~\ref{Single_Iron_21mm_Shield}. 
This single layer shield of iron with 
a thickness of 21~mm and an inner diameter of 68~mm will sufficiently protect 
the H8500 up to an external  field of 2500~G. 
%In Fig.~\ref{Single_NETIC_21mm_PMT_Region}, it is shown that
% NETIC will give an additional 5\% in tolerance, allowing the shielded 
%H8500 to operate in an external magnetic field of 2600 Gauss. However,
% this additional shielding is not required, as the downstream H8500 will
% be located in a region where the magnetic field is no greater than
% 2000 Gauss

\section{Triple Layer Ferromagnetic Shield for R2083 PMT.}
\label{tlfs}
%Under current methods of magnetic shielding design for PMTs,
Preliminary consideration with  methods recommended by manufacturers
hints  that  a triple shield with thick outer layer may  sufficiently reduce 
the inner PMT  fields below 0.1G  in both  upstream and downstream R2083 PMTs.
Since the upstream side is  more critical we have started our analysis with the 
downstream  side. Due to restrictions by the  PMT manufacturer, the inner layer 
is of a fixed size and material - 0.8mm thick 
high permeability mu-metal, similar to  Co-Netic. 
The outermost shield has a maximum of thickness of 1.7~cm due to 
the design constrains. It may be either  soft iron or Netic.


\subsection{Downstream Shield. Limitations and  optimising.}

The initial design of  the  downstream  shield  is 
shown  in Fig.~\ref{R2083_Initial}.
This shield  was  tested for its ability to reduce the external magnetic field of 1000~G 
to within the tolerance of $0.1G$. Field map inside the multilayer shield has been 
calculated with  the POISSON-Superfish  program, which performs two-dimensional net 
calculations in a limited space.  A given  axial field inside the cylindrical shield  
area   has been created by a thin solenoid with  significantly larger sizes.
The boundary conditions enforced that the field lines be parallel to the borders.
 
The corresponding field map at 1000G is  also shown  in Fig.~\ref{R2083_Initial}. 
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}
%
Shown in this figure is actually  a quarter of the full axis-symmetric configuration
with the bottom-left corner being the center of the setup. 
The PMT  occupies a box with coordinate (0,0) and (4.5,2.3)~cm,  while the  photo 
cathode is located at  z=4.5~cm. 

According to this map, the central  field  inside of this  three layer assembly 
is  below $0.5$G. 
However,  field  increase towards   open ends of the shield, due to a
penetrating  axial field lines
\footnote{An example of such  field line will be shown  in Fig.\ref{VBT3CYUS2}}. 
At the photo cathode the field  is as high as  $0.8$G.  

As we have admitted,  the fringe  fields  of $0.2-0.5$~G are 
critical  for  timing PMTs. Therefore, in order to achieve fields  below $0.1$G in 
the region of the PMT dynode system, a further optimization was performed.  
We describe that  in  Section-\ref{R2083_Triple_No_Coil}.  
Within shield design  limitations, varying sizes 
for the middle layer of the shield were tested, as well as the utilization of both NETIC and 
iron in the outer layer.

%combination would prove effective.

\subsection{Downstream Shield  in varying field.} 
\label{R2083_Triple_No_Coil}
In the initial shield design in Fig.~\ref{R2083_Initial}, the middle shielding 
layer is composed of 0.3~cm of Hiperm49, while the outermost layer is composed
of 1.5~cm thick of either iron or NETIC. Both outer shield materials were
tested at varying magnetic fields, from 250~G to 1250~G, in increments of 250~G.
In our tests we  monitor the following  points inside PMT:
 (0,0) and (2.3,0) at  the median plane where the  first PMT dynode is situated;
 (0,5) and (2.3,5) at  the PMT entry window.
In order to avoid  saturation effects we monitor the bulk of ferro-magnetics at points:
 (2.9,0) and (2.9,5) - inner layer; 
 (3.8,0) and (3.8,5) - middle layer; 
(5.5,0) and (5.5,5)  - outer layer.
All points are given in (r,z) form and are expressed in centimeters.
\paragraph{Calculations and results}
 As seen in Fig.~\ref{R2083_Initial_Iron_PMT_Region},
the  magnetic field of 700~G  was depressed up to 0.4-0.9~G in the inner space  of  the
iron shield.
 Inside the Netic shield  residual field ranges from 0.4~G to 0.9~G at higher external  field of
850G. That  may be  seen  in Fig.~\ref{R2083_Initial_NETIC_PMT_Region}.

The inner PMT fields in both cases  are  significantly  higher of the  required values  even 
at  twice lower external fields. Moreover, the outer shield layer is already  reached  its maximum 
thickness as allowed by the current CTOF design.  Thus, the effectiveness  of both shields is not sufficient. 

We have tried to  improve  performance  by increasing the thickness 
of the middle layer  from 0.3~cm to the maximum allowed by the design 
of 0.8~cm. The result is shown in  Fig.~\ref{R2083_Triple_0.8cm_PMT_Region}.  It is seen from this figure 
that even with an outer layer of NETIC at 1.5~cm thick,
the maximum allowed by the current CTOF design, and a middle layer 
of Hiperm49 at 0.8~cm thick, it is not possible to decrease the internal
magnetic field to below 0.1~G.

%\subsubsection{Performance limit and 
We conclude that  a  triple shielding  is  not  
sufficient for the R2083 in the environments of the CTOF detector.
It looks like  the last resort of ferromagnetic shields is  exhausted  under the 
burden of design constrains.
However, we have succeeded to  find a new  approach described in the 
following Section-\ref{novelle}, in which we also  
have  developed a novel  hybrid ferromagnetic shield. 
Such shield allows  to attain fields below 0.1G in both  upstream and
downstream PMTs at nominal external fields.

\section{Novel Dynamical Magnetic Shields with Compensating Coil.}
\label{novelle}
As it was shown in the previous sections the inner field of a shielding cylinder
is determined by the   magnetisation  of a ferromagnetic material.  The last   is  sensible to
%fabrication technologies and 
the applied magnetic field.
Our main idea is to control the magnetisation of shield cylinder
using active elements such as coils or solenoids, wind  around the 
ferromagnetic components of the shield, i.e. active elements is placed outside the 
shielding cylinder.  The current through the external solenoid  is set to 
reduce the  magnetisation of the ferromagnetic. Thus, the field inside the cylinder 
is also reduced due to  boundary conditions.

We call the  combination  of passive  and active shielding elements  as ``hybrid shield'' or 
``dynamical shield''. In the following sections  we show that with such shields  it is possible to  
attaining fields below 0.1~G at high external fields.

It is important to notice that if the coil is placed $inside$ the cylinder, 
than the  effect may be even opposite to expectations. The reason is that the   
additional   magnetisation of a ferromagnetic cylinder,  caused by  the inner solenoid, 
is opposite to the field inside the coil. 
Therefore, decreasing magnetisation of the external  cylinder is accompanied with increasing field inside the
solenoid, i.e. in the PMT area.  Thus, two opposite fields  does not allow a stable compromise.
 
%With the purpose of attaining fields below 0.1G we suggest to use a
%\subsection{Dynamical shield  design.}

On Fig.~\ref{VBT3CYUS1} we present the  design and the corresponding field map  
for the Hybrid magnetic shield with a compensating solenoid inside the shield assembly. 
The coil is placed between  middle and  inner layers. The detailed magnetic field map  is 
shown in Fig.~\ref{VBT3CYUS2}.

\subsection{Upstream dynamical shield for R2083.}
%As seen from  the Fig.~\ref{VBT3CYUS2} the inner  PMT field is  far  below 0.1G,  
%while the  external field is as high as 400G. 
The  shield shown in Fig.~\ref{VBT3CYUS1}  may be used at the 
upstream side of the CTOF detector, since it tolerates fields of 400~G. 
% It tolerates the nominal  value of external field. 
%According to the model  shown in Fig.\ref{VBT3CYUS1}
%a relatively small  current
%below  1A  in   ~1mm thick wire is enough
%to reduce the inner PMT  field  below 0.1G.
%This conclusion is of high  practical importance since the
%DC is limited by $~/approx2A$ per mm^2.
%In the  model shown in Fig.\ref{VBT3CYUS1}
 At such  external field the total current  through all winds of  compensating  coil 
is $\approx100A$, while  the coil is  $\approx200mm$ long.
Therefore,  the coil  may consist of  200 winds  of 1mm thick wire  with a small current of .5A through the wire. 
That  means a very low power dissipation.  This conclusion is of high  practical importance, since 
the  current   below  $~\approx 2A$ per mm$^2$ prevents coils from  overheating.
Certainly,  higher fields may be  exterminated with a higher currents in the  coil, 
provided that ferromagnetic does not saturates.

Thus, Hybrid Magnetic Shield looks  very promising. Therefore
we have  further  developed   and  prototyped  such shields.
Below we describe our first practical tests with  two dynamical shield prototypes.
% of the hybrid magnetic shields.

\subsection{Prototyping and Testing.}
In this section  we describe two   prototypes for  the inner active layer of the hybrid
magnetic shield.  Both  prototypes are a ferromagnetic cylinders wind  
with a ~1mm thick wires forming the external  compensating coils.
Ferromagnetic properties of  prototypes are  different.  Their  performance was studied  
at  magnetic fields below 100~G.  Such low fields  are  
expected  after   two  external layers of  a triple  shield.
The almost uniform external field was produced by the Helmholtz Coils 2m in diameter. 
The Gauss-meter was placed in the center of the shield.  On our tests we observed the 
inner field  varying the current in the compensation coil at given  external field.
\paragraph{Measurements with Hiperm-49 prototype.}
First   prototype is the Hiperm-49 200~mm long tube. It is   1.6~mm thick with the inner radius 
75mm. The compensating coil consists of 108 turns of $~1$mm thick wire wind around the 
ferromagnetic tube. The internal field of this  prototype vs the coil current 
was tested at external field 75~G  produced by Helmholtz coils. 
The result is shown  in Fig.\ref{hypermdysh}.As one can see from this figure, the 
inner field drops to zero at the current 0.5~A through the wire, then it increase  with  
significantly lower rate.
\paragraph{Measurements with $\mu$-metal prototype.}
The second prototype is the $\mu$-metal cylinder  150~mm in inner  diameter and 0.8~mm  thick.
The external compensating coil consists of 50 winds of 2mm thick wire.
The inner field in function on the coil current  at 35~G  external field  is
shown  in Fig.\ref{mumedysh}. Zero inner field has been achieved  at   
$\approx$0.9A through the wire, then it climbs with the same rate.  
Hence, due to a higher permeability and, perhaps, significantly  lower  
Hysteresis effects,  the $\mu$-metal exhibits  more regular behavior than  Hiperm-49.
\paragraph{}
Thus, our first practical tests show the vitality of
the idea of using compensating coils. The practical realisation of such 
shielding looks easy, since in order to exterminate fields of 50-100~G
only one layer of winding is required, while the current trough the wires
is as low as 1~A. 
The shield  shown in Fig.~\ref{VBT3CYUS1} has a compensating coil wind around the innermost cylinders.
This shield has demonstrated  a good performance in  simulations  and experimental tests.
Therefore, it is  considered  as a prototype for the    the Upstream R2083 shield.

\subsection{Downstream Tapered  Shield for R2083.}
In our previous calculations, it was observed that the 
internal B-field  in the outermost shielding layer was 
non-uniform across the length of the shield, becoming greater
towards the median of the cylinder.
This effect may be seen from any calculated field map as follows.
For example, in Fig. \ref{R2083_Initial}
we observe that field lines are captured  by the outer cylinder almost perpendicular
to its surface. Then, due to a very high permeability, all filed lines
run  almost parallel to the axis. Therefore  magnetic flux density 
increase, roughly linearly, towards the median of the cylinder. 
Thus, the  most critical  place, where the  effect of  ferromagnetic saturation 
shows up first, is just  the median plane.  In the vicinity of the  median plane 
the external field lines are almost perpendicular. 
Therefore they efficiently penetrate through a ``hole'' created by a 
saturated ferromagnetic into the PMT area, that explains the shield performance
collapse at high shield length. 

In order to make magnetisation more uniform across the ferromagnetic and avoid such saturation effects
we suggest an improved  design. This design  involves the use of a tapered outer cylinder,
the  thickness of which  linearly increase  towards the median plane.

\paragraph{Design}
The design with tapered outer cylinder, in combination with the correction coil  between
two innermost layers, is shown in  Fig.~\ref{Tapered_Shield_Design}.
Due to its availability by the manufacturer, NETIC can not be used  for the outermost shield, as it 
is available only in sheets with maximum thickness of 4-6~mm. 
%

\caption{\small{Initial design of tapered shield with correction coil.

graph here is shown when the correction coil is set to 25 A.}}
\label{Tapered_Shield_Design}
\end{figure}
%
Therefore, the outermost  shield is composed of Soft Iron, beginning with a thickness of 1.0~cm and 
slowly thickening to 1.7~cm thick. 
The middle layer is made of Hiperm-49 3~mm thick while  the inner layer is Co-Netic 
0.8~mm thick.
%and the external magnetic field is kept constant at 1000~G.
%Initially, this design was tested with a middle layer of 0.5~cm
%thick of hiperm49.
% Figure \ref{Tapered_Shield_0.5cm_PMT_Region} depicts the internal
%magnetic field, 
%while Figs.~\ref{Tapered_Shield_0.5cm_Outer_Region}
%~\ref{Tapered_Shield_0.5cm_Middle_Region},
% and~\ref{Tapered_Shield_0.5cm_Inner_Region} shows the
%saturation inside the three layers of
% shielding. The POISSON models show that it is possible
%to bring the entire PMT region to below
% 0.1~G when the correction coil curent is set at
%$\approx 27$~A. It is interesting to observe
% that as the current increases, the saturation
%inside the innermost CONETIC layer decreases,
% which is counter to previous studies.
%Following the successful testing of this 
%esign, the thickness of the middle layer was reduced
% from 0.5 cm thick to 0.3 cm thick  for the purpose of weight and cost.
\paragraph{Performance}
The performance of this  shield, as a candidate to the downstream R2083 shield, 
was studied at constant external field 1000G and varying current through the 
compensating coil. 
As in our previous tests,  we  monitor field values inside PMT in the following  points:
 (0,0) and (2.3,0) at  the median plane with the  first PMT dynode;
           (0,5) and (2.3,5) at  the PMT entry window.
We also monitor the bulk of ferro-magnetics for a possible saturation:
(2.9,0) and (2.9,5) - inner layer; 
  (4,0) and (4,5) - middle layer; 
(5.5,0) and (5.5,5)  - outer layer.
These points are given in (r,z) form and are expressed in centimeters.


The resulting fields in function upon the coil current 
are shown in  Fig.~\ref{Tapered_Shield_0.3cm_PMT_Region}.
It is observed that the internal magnetic field of the PMT region is below 0.05 G 
when the correction coil current
\footnote{This is a total current through the (r,z) plane. The wire current is of 100 times lower}
is set between 
$25-30$~A.
It is also of interest to note that at this high magnetic field,
none of three ferromagnetic cylinders have reached saturation, as depicted in 
Fig.~\ref{Tapered_Shield_0.3cm_Outer_Region} 
Fig.~\ref{Tapered_Shield_0.3cm_Middle_Region},
and Fig.~\ref{Tapered_Shield_0.3cm_Inner_Region}, 
respectively.
 Additionally, the magnetic flux density within the PMT region is much more uniform
than previously observed.

Thus, the dynamical shield described in this section is an  excellent candidate 
to R2083 shield in the downstream region of the CTOF detector.

\section{Conclusion and outlook.}
In Section-\ref{ednmics} of this paper we have developed a 
simple theory of ferromagnetic  shield in axial fields.
%With this simple theory the  interpretation of  FEA calculations, which manifest 
%many unexpected effects, such as shield performance  collaps at increasing  length,
%is unambiguous.
Numerous FEA calculations were also  performed for various shields for both upstream and 
downstream regions of the CTOF detector. These calculations 
have demonstrated that the dynamics of coaxial   ferromagnetic cylinders is very
complex. Some  unexpected effects were manifested by the models, such as  performance  
collapse with increasing  length.  This effect was predicted  by our simple   theory.
Hence, this  simple theory allows a  clear and unambiguous   interpretation of  
FEA calculations, sometimes surprising, in relation to the  designing of real shields.

With the  help of the POISSON program we have designed a  single layer  ferromagnetic 
shield which  sufficiently protects  metal channel PMTs H8500 up to 2000-2500G 
external fields.   
                                                        
Given the restrictions from the  design with R2083 PMTs in Section-\ref{R2083_Triple_No_Coil}, 
the best possible configuration for the triple ferromagnetic  shield was found. 
However, even such exotic  and expensive shield 
will  be effective  to satisfy the stringent 0.4~G tolerance, only.

%with the res
%Such shield consists of the 
%outer cylinder of NETIC 1.5~cm thick,  a middle
% cylinder of Hiperm49  0.8~cm thick  and 
%the innermost layer of Co-NETIC, whose thickness is fixed at 
%0.08~cm by the  manufacturer. trictions imposed by the
%manufacturer and the detector  design,  
%will not be effective enough to satisfy the
%stringent 0.1~G tolerance. 
%Thus, we conclude that the triple shield  
%with the restrictions imposed by the
%manufacturer and the CTOF  specifications  
In order to  attain fields below 0.1~G we have developed a novel 
Dynamical Magnetic Shield which consists  of ferro-magnetics layers 
and  solenoids  between the layers. 
Such shield was tested within  POISSON models and  
and experimentally.  The dynamical layers  has demonstrated  excellent  performance.   
%Experimental tests shows that a thin (0.8mm) single layer dynamical shield 
%is capable to cancel  fields of 30-70G to practical zero at very low currents($\approx$0.5A)
%through the wire.  
%With such dynamical layer, included into the POISSON model, 
%the inner PMT field has been reduced  to $\leq$0.05G at 1000G external field
%permitting the R2083 to operate with high timing resolution.
Additional advantage of more uniform field inside a PMT has been achieved by
a tapered design of the external cylinder. 
Due to  all that  the most heavy and expensive outer layer may be fabricated of soft 
iron which is a commonly used material. 

Thus, basic designs of both upstream and downstream   shields for R2083 and
H8500 PMTs are completed. These shields are designed to tolerate 
external fields 500~G and 1000~G respectively.  These values  are twice higher of the nominal values
from the main Solenoid field map. The inner PMT field in both shields will be below 0.1~G due to 
the dynamical components of shields.
 
We plan further tests with  POISSON models. Firstly, 
%the inner PMT field will be studied in function on the external field at different currents. 
the performance limit will be determined in terms of power dissipation in the compensating coils.  
Secondly, the effect of deviation from standard magnetisation curves of basic ferro-magnetics  will be addressed. 
We also plan further prototyping of  dynamical shields  and testing their performance with the 5T solenoid.

\section{Further  possible studies with micro channel PMTs}


\paragraph{Motivation} manufacturers($Burle$) of the micro channel
plate PMTs are making progress
          in the design of the MCP PMs. This may result in higher
          counting rate and higher magnetic field immunity, as well.
          $Burle$ is developing 10- an 5-micron MCP PMs such as 18mm 85104
	  with increased QE of $20-30\%$ .
\begin{enumerate}

     \item
Develop a setup of 2 10(5) micron MCP PMs with on board
          pre-amplifiers.

     \item
perform resolution/counting rate  tests with 2 MCP PMTs
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Current status} preliminary publications are done
                and  preliminary discussions  with the detector group members.
We plan  to  publish  in NIM our recent results obtained with Burle
          85011 PMs. This paper will include the description of the
          on-board preamplifier, resolution measurements and, perhaps ,
          magnetic field tests performed by the detector group.

\paragraph{Labor}     $40 man\times day$ for  Pre-Amp/HV dividers by the
Detector Group.
\paragraph{Equipment} Electronic lab of JLAB for  Pre-Amp/HV dividers.
\paragraph{Materials} 2 MCP  PMTs, HV components  for voltage dividers.
\paragraph{Funding}   8000\$(from Detector Group?) for 2 MCP  PMTs and electronics

\subsection{Magnetic Shield for the XP4508B Photomultiplier Tube}
%(Travis insert writeup here)
A magnetic shielding model was developed and theoretically 
tested for the 5 inch XP 4508B Photomultiplier tube.  
The program Poisson Super fish was used to examine the shielding properties of
various shield setups subject to an external magnetic field up to 60 Gauss.  
The sensitivity of the PMT requires a very low (~.2 Gauss) 
magnetic field at the location of the photo cathode.

\subsubsection{Single Layer Shielding}

The first shield design tested was a single 1.6mm 
thick shield surrounding the PMT with an inner radius of 7.657cm. 
 An external magnetic field was applied to the shielded area ranging from
0 to 60 Gauss.  The calculated magnetic field strength was recorded
 at critical points (the center of the shielded area, location of the
 photo cathode, close to the inner radius of the shield,
and inside the shield).  The calculations were performed with 2 different
 materials, conetic and hyperm49.  The ferromagnetic properties of these materials
were well known, so we wanted to see how well they would perform in our 
particular configuration.  Experimental data was also collected for this 
size shielding made of a $50\%$ alloy of Ni Fe
and was compared to our theoretical calculations.  The graph below shows
 the strength of the magnetic field at the center of the shield for the 
different materials listed.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{SS_Materials.eps}
\caption{\small{Single Shield Material Comparison}}
\label{Single mu-metal shield 1.6mm thick 76mm in radius.}
\end{figure}



None of these 3 shields performed adequately enough to limit the strength of 
the magnetic field to less than 0.1 Gauss when an external field of around 50 G
 was applied, so we explored the effect of increasing the thickness of the shield.  
Calculations were performed for a single 3.2mm thick shield with the same inner
 radius of 7.657cm with 4 materials: regular iron, netic (soft iron),conetic, 
and hyperm49.  Increasing the thickness of the shield clearly helped to provide
 better shielding from the external field, but not by a significant enough
 amount to achieve the desired field of 0.1 Gauss.  This led us to conclude 
a single layer shield would be insufficient for our design, so we began to
 test 2 layer shielding models; however, we were able to determine that 
hyperm49 and conetic performed much better than 
netic or iron, with hyperm49 
seemingly the best for our purposes.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{SS_32.eps}
\caption{\small{Magnetic Field at location of Photo cathode}}
\label{Single Shield 3.2mm Thick}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{2 Layer Shielding}

Four   configurations were tested for 2 layer shields with fixed
 inner diameters of 5.795 and 6.135 inches for the inner and outer 
shields, respectively.  The inner shield was made of conetic and was
 either 1.0mm or 1.6mm thick, while the outer shield was made of netic 
(soft iron) and was either 4.0mm or 6.0mm thick.  The strength of the
 magnetic field was again calculated and recorded at the location of
 the photo cathode, shown below.  The varying thicknesses made very little 
difference in the calculated magnetic field strength (less than 0.1 G),
 but the setup with the maximum thicknesses (netic at 6.0mm, conetic 1.6mm)
 was slightly better than the others.  The measured magnetic field at H=50
 Gauss was still 0.79G, which is still far too high for the PMT to operate correctly.

\subsubsection{3 Layer Shielding}

For these calculations a 3rd shield was introduced, 
the shield manufactured by Photon is that was distributed
 with the PMT.  This shield is made of Mu-Metal MS175, but
 we approximated this material with our known magnetic
 permeability for the Mu-Metal conetic.  The outer 2 shields were
 the exact same as in the 2 layer model described above, so we
 merely repeated the same calculations with the addition of this 
third inner shield of conetic.  The addition of this third shield
 helped somewhat, but not to the degree required to reduce the
 field to 0.1 or 0.2 Gauss.  The recorded field at the location
 of the photo cathode was still about 0.6 Gauss with a 6mm netic
 outer shield and 1.6mm conetic middle shield.

From our 1 layer shielding calculations,
 it was clear that hyperm49 would provide better
 shielding than netic, so we modified the 3 layer model
 above by switching the material of the outer shield from 
netic to hyperm49.  Since the best 3 layer shield was with
 a 6mm thick layer of netic and a 1.6mm thick layer of conetic,
 we used these sizes for this model as well, with a 6mm thick
 layer of hyperm49, a 1.6mm thick layer of conetic, and the inner
 Photonis shield of conetic.  This simple alteration helped to 
improve the shielding of the model significantly, reducing the magnetic
 field strength at the photo cathode from 0.69 to 0.28 at an external
 field strength of 50G.  The field strength at an external field of 35G 
(which is the expected field strength) is about 0.2G, which is close to
 the required level for correct operation of the PMT.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

From the variety of calculations performed, it is clear that a
 3 layer shielding model using the materials Hyperm49 and conetic
 would provide the best shielding from external fields up to 60 Gauss.  
The best model tested was an outer shield of Hyperm49 with 6mm thickness
 and 6.135 inch inner diameter, a middle shield of conetic with 1.6mm 
thickness and 5.795 inch inner diameter, and the inner Photonis Mu-metal
 shield with inner diameter 5.500 inches.  
This model would reduce an
 external field of ~35G to ~0.2G at the location of the photo cathode. 
 Further improvements on this shielding model might involve a thicker
 outer shield of hyperm49, lengthening of shields (in the axial direction)
 to extend farther from the photo cathode, or replacing the Photonis inner
 shield with one of different size.  The materials hyperm49 and conetic
 perform nearly identically up to about a 50G external field (at which 
point hyperm49 becomes far superior), so interchanging conetic and hyperm49
 on the inner shields would probably not have a significant effect on the
 strength of the magnetic field.




From this section we conclude that in order to achieve the fields below 0.2G
we have to develop some new solutions. One of such solutions is 
described in the following section.

\section{Magnetic Shield for the XP4508B Photomultiplier Tube}

A magnetic shielding model was developed and theoretically tested for the 5 inch XP4508B Photomultiplier tube.  The program Poisson Superfish was used to examine the shielding properties of 
various shield setups subject to an external magnetic field up to 60 Gauss.  The sensitivity of the PMT requires a very low (~.2 Gauss) magnetic field at the location of the photo cathode.

\subsection{Single Layer Shielding}

The first shield design tested was a single 1.6mm thick shield surrounding the PMT with an inner radius of 7.657cm.  An external magnetic field was applied to the shielded area ranging from
0 to 60 Gauss.  The calculated magnetic field strength was recorded at critical points (the center of the shielded area, location of the photo cathode, close to the inner radius of the shield,
and inside the shield).  The calculations were performed with 2 different materials, conetic and hyperm49.  The ferromagnetic properties of these materials 
were all well known, so we wanted to see how well they would perform in our particular configuration.  Experimental data was also collected for this size shielding made of a 50% alloy of NiFe
and was compared to our theoretical calculations.  The graph below shows the strength of the magnetic field at the center of the shield for the different materials listed.

None of these 3 shields performed adequately enough to limit the strength of the magnetic field to less than 0.1 Gauss when an external field of around 50 G was applied, so we explored the effect of increasing the thickness of the shield.  Calculations were performed for a single 3.2mm thick shield with the same inner radius of 7.657cm with 4 materials: regular iron, netic (soft iron),conetic, and hyperm49.  Increasing the thickness of the shield clearly helped to provide better shielding from the external field, but not by a significant enough amount to achieve the desired field of 0.1 Gauss.  This led us to conclude a single layer shield would be insufficient for our design, so we began to test 2 layer shielding models; however, we were able to determine that hyperm49 and conetic performed much better than netic or iron, with hyperm49 seemingly the best for our purposes.

\subsection{2 Layer Shielding}

As directed by my mentor, I tested 4 different configurations for 2 layer shields with fixed inner diameters of 5.795 and 6.135 inches for the inner and outer shields, respectively.  The inner shield was made of conetic and was either 1.0mm or 1.6mm thick, while the outer shield was made of netic (soft iron) and was either 4.0mm or 6.0mm thick.  The strength of the magnetic field was again calculated and recorded at the location of the photo cathode, shown below.  The varying thicknesses made very little difference in the calculated magnetic field strength (less than 0.1 G), but the setup with the maximum thicknesses (netic at 6.0mm, conetic 1.6mm) was slightly better than the others.  The measured magnetic field at H=50 Gauss was still 0.79G, which is still far too high for the PMT to operate correctly.

\subsection{3 Layer Shielding}

For these calculations a 3rd shield was introduced, the shield manufactured by Photonis that was distributed with the PMT.  This shield is made of Mu-Metal MS175, but we approximated this material with our known magnetic permeability for the Mu-Metal conetic.  The outer 2 shields were the exact same as in the 2 layer model described above, so we merely repeated the same calculations with the addition of this third inner shield of conetic.  The addition of this third shield helped somewhat, but not to the degree required to reduce the field to 0.1 or 0.2 Gauss.  The recorded field at the location of the photo cathode was still about 0.6 Gauss with a 6mm netic outer shield and 1.6mm conetic middle shield.

From our 1 layer shielding calculations, it was clear that hyperm49 would provide better shielding than netic, so we modified the 3 layer model above by switching the material of the outer shield from netic to hyperm49.  Since the best 3 layer shield was with a 6mm thick layer of netic and a 1.6mm thick layer of conetic, we used these sizes for this model as well, with a 6mm thick layer of hyperm49, a 1.6mm thick layer of conetic, and the inner Photonis shield of conetic.  This simple alteration helped to improve the shielding of the model significantly, reducing the magnetic field strength at the photo cathode from 0.69 to 0.28 at an external field strength of 50G.  The field strength at an external field of 35G (which is the expected field strength) is about 0.2G, which is close to the required level for correct operation of the PMT.

\subsection{Hybrid Magnetic Shielding with R2083}

In conjunction with the triple shield model from Fig.~\ref{R2083_Initial}, 
it has been proposed that the use of a correction coil placed between two layers
 of shielding should decrease the magnetic field to below the 0.1~G threshold required 
by the R2083. In all tests involving a correction coil,
 the external magnetic field was kept at a constant 1000~G.

\subsubsection{Effect of Correction Coil}

The initial shield design shown in Fig.~\ref{R2083_Initial} was reconfigured such that the 
middle shielding layer of Hiperm49 was increased to 0.5~cm thick, 
and the outer layer of NETIC is 1.0~cm thick. 
This was done to reduce the weight and cost of the materials. The new design with the correction coil
 between the CONETIC and Hiperm49 layer is shown 
in Fig.~\ref{R2083CorrectionCoilStandardDesign.eps}.

\end{figure}

In order to understand the behavior of the internal magnetic field as it approached 0~G,
 the sign of the z-component of the magnetic field was used in conjunction with the 
absolute magnitude of the total magnetic field. 
As seen in Fig.~\ref{R2083_Correction_Coil_PMT_Region}, the utilization of the correction coil is capable of reducing the internal magnetic field to within acceptable tolerances, but this design requires further optimization.
