  
The present design will allow momentum
determination with a resolution better than 1$\%$ at theta =30 degrees
and better than 0.5$\%$ at theta = 20 degrees for all momenta between 0.5
and 10 GeV/c.  The spatial part of the momentum resolution is 
a factor of three better than for the present CLAS chambers, due 
to a couple of factors: the chambers' intrinsic resolution should
improve from the present 330 microns to about 200 microns on average,
due to smaller cell sizes and more linear drift velocities and we
expect another gain of almost a factor of two from better knowledge
of the B field and the chamber positions, made possible by the smaller
size of the chambers.

The forward tracking system consists of three regions as shown in 
Fig. ~\ref{fig:CLAS12 FDC} in each sector;
located just before, inside and just outside the torus field volume, and
referred to as regions 1, 2 and 3.  Each chamber will have its wires 
arranged in two superlayers of six layers each, with the wires in the two 
superlayers strung at +6, -6 degrees stereo angles, respectively.  The cell 
structure will be hexagonal, that is, each sense wire is surrounded by six
field wires.  This arrangement is similar to the present CLAS design
and offers good resolution with very good pattern recognition properties.

The wire spacing will be about 70$\%$ the present CLAS values.  
Use of thicker sense wires will result in  shorter drift times and
a more linear drift velocity.  These changes result in a better high-rate
capability.  
The chambers will be located further from the target than in the present
design, e.g. region 1 will be 2 meters from the target; in the present
design it is about 0.5 meters from the target. Overall, 
the chambers will provide momentum resolutions of 0.5 to 1$\%$,
angular resolutions generally better than 0.5 mrad, and good efficiencies
under rate conditions expected at a luminosity greater $10^{35}cm^-{2}sec^{-1}$.
