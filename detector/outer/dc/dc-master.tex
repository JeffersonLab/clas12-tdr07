\subsection{Mechanical Design}

The chambers are designed to position the wires with 100~$\mu$m
accuracy and to be robust and easily serviceable.  The chambers are 
being designed with in-position surveying in mind.  In order to cover 
angles down to 5$^\circ$ the dead areas of each chamber (endplates, 
printed circuit boards, etc.) must be made as small as possible.  
The chambers in the high-field region (Region~2) must not be susceptible 
to eddy-current forces that might arise in the event of a quench of the 
superconducting torus.

We have arrived at different solutions for the three regions, but they
share some characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item a very accurately drilled, flat endplate is affixed to a much stiffer
frame;
\item the flanges of the frame extend beyond the endplate thickness but
do not further increase the dead area of the chamber;
\item the chambers can be supported from two points only, at two ends of
the outer ``back'' plate;
\item the Region~1 and Region~3 chambers are fully self-supporting, in any 
orientation relative to gravity, by the aforementioned two-point attachment;
\item to further minimize dead area, the Region~2 chamber will have a portion
of the wire tension borne by springs attached to the torus cryostat;
\item when out of position, the Region~2 chamber will have temporary posts
in compression taking the wire tension;
\item signal translator boards (STB) will be mounted on the chamber and
provide a connection between wire crimp pins and the on-board pre-amplifier
hybrid units;
\item similarly, on-board high-voltage translator boards (HVTB) provide a
connection to the high-voltage for each group of wires;
\item on-board cables will run from the STBs and HVTBs to a connector
box on the back plate.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Wire Layout: Cells, Layers, Superlayers}

The wires are laid out in a ``brick-wall'' pattern with a guard wire
layer followed by two layers of field wires and one layer of sense
wires in a repeating pattern.  Six layers of sense wires and their 
corresponding field and guard layers constitute a single superlayer.
All of the wires in one superlayer are parallel.  As we progress through
the three regions, the superlayers are alternately $U$, $V$, $U$, $V$, 
$U$, and $V$ with ``$U$'' representing wires with a +6\degg stereo angle 
and ``$V$'', -6\degg.  The present {\tt CLAS} detector has a similar wire 
layout structure and we have had very robust track-finding ability, even in 
the presence of modest backgrounds (up to 4\% occupancy levels) and in the 
presence of malfunctioning areas of the chambers; tracking is still 
efficient even with only 5 superlayers active.

The proposed chambers are planar; all wires in a given layer lie within
a plane; as opposed to the present {\tt CLAS} where wires in a given layer 
lie on a cylindrical surface.  This has the advantage that all cells 
within a given layer are equal-sized, facilitating calibration.

\subsubsection{Endplates and Box Assembly}

The chamber body consists of a precisely-drilled flat endplate fitted into a 
stiff, machined frame.  We have completed the design of a full-sized Region~1 
prototype chamber and show the results here.  Fig.~\ref{dcassy} shows the 
essential elements of the drift chamber: the endplates, the ``backplate'', the 
stiffening ``rails'' into which the endplates fit and the ``noseplate'' which 
fits into a common hexagonal support ring.  Fig.~\ref{endplate} shows design 
details for the endplate itself and Fig.~\ref{frame} shows how the endplates 
fit into the associated box frame.  Table~\ref{reg1-design-parms} lists the 
design parameters for the Region~1 prototype chamber.  Fig. ~\ref{reg1fea} 
shows expected deflections of the endplate assembly after stringing (relative 
to unstrung).

\subsubsection{Wires, Feedthroughs, Crimp Pins}

Table~\ref{wirechoices} lists the materials and specifications for our wires, 
feedthroughs, and crimp pins.  Our endplates are not parallel to each other, 
but instead are oriented with respect to each other at an angle of 60$^\circ$.  
For this reason, the wire position is fixed, not by the location of the crimp, 
but by the position at which the wire leaves the end of the feedthrough.  This 
concept was tested before the present {\tt CLAS} construction.  The nominal 
wire-stringing tension was enough to force the wire to the ``bottom'' of the 
feedthrough mouth, establishing the position within an accuracy of 25~$\mu$m.  
Fig.~\ref{feedthrough} shows the details of a feedthrough penetration.

\subsubsection{Attachment Points}

The chambers are being designed to be supported from two points on the back 
plate without imposing a large change of stress on the wires.  This will 
facilitate installation.  Fig.~\ref{dcassy} shows a sketch of the 
attachments on the back plate of the chamber.


\subsubsection{Survey, Alignment, and Magnetic Field Mapping}

The chambers are being designed with survey and alignment in mind.  For 
accurate tracking the chamber locations must be well-known in space; 
especially with respect to the magnetic field.  Survey points will be 
located on accessible faces of the chamber frame.  Internal surveys 
(see Section~\ref{internal}) will transfer our knowledge of the location 
of wire holes to these faces.

The magnetic field mapping strategy has not been worked out pending
a final design of the torus magnet, but the concept will be to use
Hall probes to locate the positions of the energized conductors within
the cryostats to very good accuracy, and then to calculate the fields.
We are taking advantage of very precise magnetic probe technology and
also of sophisticated software packages to calculate fields.
This allows us to design small, precise instruments which can abut
the cryostats themselves and be surveyed accurately.

\subsection{Electronic Readout}

The signal connections to the wires are made through printed-circuit boards
mounted along one side of each chamber, called Signal Translator 
Boards (STB).  These boards are responsible for signal
routing and pre-amplification.  On the opposite side of each sector, another
set of circuit boards (HVTB) is used to make the high-voltage connections
to the wires.

\subsubsection{On-chamber PCBs and Cables}

The {\tt CLAS12} wire chamber geometry changes significantly from {\tt CLAS}, 
so the circuit boards that interface the high voltages for the field, sense, 
and guard wires are new designs.  The circuit boards that interface the 
sense wires to the pre-amplifiers (STB) are also new designs.   These 
interface circuit boards, both for high voltage and pre-amplifier, will be 
designed on a 96-channel format.  This format will allow only seven circuit 
boards for each superlayer.  Each sector in a particular region, will use these 
seven circuit board formats for either high voltage, or pre-amplification of 
the sense wire signal.  Table~\ref{electronic-channels} gives a channel count 
of the system.  Fig.~\ref{r1stb} shows the traces routed from the signal pick-up
at the plated-through holes to the signal inputs to the pre-amplifier.
Fig.~\ref{proto:r1} shows how the boards will fit on the chamber.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

designed.}}
\label{r1stb}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fortunately the pre-amplifier used for the {\tt CLAS} drift chambers can still 
be manufactured and the components are readily available.  A large order 
for the {\tt CLAS} pre-amplifier, CP01, was ordered less than two years ago, 
as replacements for the original 1994 design.  The new order included an 
epoxy resin encapsulation of the components on the pre-amplifier 
Single-Inline-Package or SIP.  The encapsulation of the components on 
the hybrid SIP pre-amplifier will prevent component corrosion.

The CP01 pre-amplifier specifications are suitable for the {\tt CLAS12} wire 
chamber signal levels, and provide the gain, dynamic range, rise time, 
low noise, and low power for the upgrade performance requirements.  
These pre-amplifiers were designed in unison with the Amplifier 
Discriminator Boards, that provide another level of amplification and of 
course a monostable discriminator pulse with the threshold setting 
optimized for the best resolution or sensitivity to a minimum ionizing 
signal.  The monostable discriminated pulse widths are then multiplexed 
into a single channel of a pipeline TDC, with a least significant count 
of 500~pS, and 8~$\mu$s of pipeline memory depth.

The low voltage power supplies used for {\tt CLAS} will be used for {\tt CLAS12}.  
These units are robust and manufactured by Hewlett Packard.  The supplies are 
remotely programmable and monitored, and will provide more than enough power for 
the new wire chamber pre-amplifier requirements.  We will use the same successful 
method of isolating the low voltage from ground loops, using local voltage 
regulators on the pre-amplifier interface boards (STBs).  The segmentation of the 
low voltage distribution cables is based on 32 preamplifier channels per supply 
cable.  Each of these supply cables is fused with an appropriate type fuse rated 
for overcurrent protection based on 32 pre-amplifier loads.  We plan to re-use 
our CAEN system 527 high voltage supplies with somewhat finer segmentation than 
our current system; consistent with our total channel count dropping from 34000 
to about 24000.

We plan to use 17 twisted pair cable for routing our signals from the STBs
to the chamber back plate.  The cable is a round jacketed cable, with a 
0.025~in pitch so that the overall cable dimension is smaller than the 
standard 17 pair cable.  This smaller outer diameter cable will only be used 
from the STBs to the on-chamber ``service panels''.  The standard 17-pair 
cable will be used from the chamber service panel to the readout electronic racks.

\subsubsection{Post-Amplifiers, Discriminators, Multiplexers, TDCs}

We plan to re-use our post-amplifier and discriminator boards, as well
as its associated multiplexing scheme.  We also plan to re-use our
LeCroy 1877 TDC modules.  For details of these systems, refer to our
drift chamber technical paper in Ref.~\cite{dcnim}.

\subsection{Gas System}

We have an extensive gas-handling system which has performed well.
We plan to re-use it.  Full details of this system and its design is 
described in our drift chamber technical paper in Ref.~\cite{dcnim}.

\input{r1proto}

\section{Construction}

The chambers are being designed with individual holes and holders for
each wire, a ``strung'' rather than a ``wound'' chamber.  Our inspection
and assembly procedures are designed to produce devices with wires placed
and known by external survey to an accuracy of 100~$\mu$m, in order to
achieve our goal of a 250~$\mu$m positional accuracy per wire layer.  In 
addition to accuracy, we have chosen materials and designed procedures to 
insure a quiet and long-lived detector.

\subsection{Inspection and Cleaning}

A visual and tactile inspection will be performed on the endplates and 
structural frame once we have accepted delivery.  If deemed necessary, 
the surfaces will be sanded using 320-grit paper on a orbital sander to 
de-burr them in preparation for measurements.  The endplates and structural 
frame will undergo a gross cleaning by soaking in a low residue laboratory 
degreasing solution with hand scrubbing followed by a high pressure water 
rinse. The parts will then receive their final cleaning using an ultrasonic 
bath of a laboratory-grade detergent solution.  After two hours they will be 
removed from the bath and rinsed with de-ionized water then sprayed with 
methanol to aid drying. Once dry, the parts are heat-sealed in nylon bags 
with a nitrogen atmosphere to await assembly.

Smaller parts such as feedthroughs and hardware are cleaned using a 
bench-top ultrasonic cleaner with laboratory detergent followed by a 
de-ionized water rinse and a dousing of methanol to facilitate drying. 
In addition, the injection molded parts are specified to be free of 
silicon mold releases.

\subsection{Box Assembly}

The box assembly for Regions~1 and 3 consist of a structural frame 
to which the endplates are attached. This is achieved by first welding 
the frame to a reasonable tolerance then skim-cutting and drilling the 
endplate-receiving surfaces of the frame in a 5-axis milling machine. 
The cleaned endplates and cleaned structural frame are then joined using 
pins to locate them with low out-gassing epoxy (Shell Epon 826 
resin/Versamid 140 hardener) on the contact surfaces and bolts to clamp 
and secure them. When the epoxy has cured, the box assembly is sent to 
the measurement lab for fiducialization. Once this is complete, the 
feedthroughs are inserted and set in place using the same epoxy that was 
used to bond the endplates to the frame.

\subsection{Internal Survey}
\label{internal}

A statistical sampling of the feedthrough hole locations and diameters 
will be performed on all endplates and structural components upon receipt 
from the vendor as part of the normal verification procedure.  The JLab
Survey Group will be using a Faro hard probe configuration on their portable 
coordinate measuring machine in a temperature-controlled laboratory for 
these measurements. The goal is to ensure the feedthrough holes are within 
the 0.200~mm true position tolerance and that the hole diameters are within 
the specified tolerance range. 

Once the box frame and endplates are assembled and before the feedthroughs 
are installed, a seven parameter least squares transformation is used to 
fiducialize the assembly in the measurement laboratory using a Faro laser 
tracker. This translation will provide a reference from the feedthrough hole 
locations on the endplates to tooling on the outside of the chamber that can 
be seen once it is installed in {\tt CLAS12}.  The chamber location in the hall 
will be ascertained also using the Faro laser tracker.  The measurement group 
will then provide a formula that we can use to determine the wire locations in 
space. We can expect an overall wire location accuracy of approximately 0.2~mm 
using this system.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\vspace{8.8cm}

\caption{\small{Location of fiducial holes which allow transfer of wire 
feedthrough locations to the front (upstream) edge of frame.}}
\label{holes}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Because of the difficulty in producing the metal inserts of the feedthroughs, 
there is a high incidence of cracks and unwanted ovality in the flared section 
of the parts. We will be measuring and qualifying each of the metal inserts 
using magnifiers and run-out jigs before shipping them to the injection molders. 


\vskip 0.2cm

\noindent
Note: 1) Faro quoted precision, point to point = 0.061~mm. Total volumetric 
precision (25 m cubed) is 0.086~mm.

\vskip 0.1cm

\noindent
Note: 2) Error budget for installed feedthrough points/line:

\vskip 0.2cm

a. Initial inspection/fiducialization of endplates = 0.086~mm.

b. Secondary fiducialization of assembled box frame fiducials = 0.05~mm.

c. Installation survey standard error = approx. 0.1~mm.

\vskip 0.2cm

The rms value for each feedthrough hole location in the installation 
would be approximately 0.14~mm. To define a point on the wire you would need 
to take the standard error for its two feedthrough holes. Therefore, 
the rms of any calculated point on the wire would be almost exactly 0.2 
mm (assuming the wire is straight). This value would then be translated 
in $X$ and $Y$ for each end of the wire to account for the offsets due to 
the feedthroughs.

\subsection{Stringing}

The detector will be gravity-strung using the same basic methodology 
used when stringing the current {\tt CLAS} drift chambers. The detector box 
assembly will be mounted to a stringing fixture.  The frame will connect 
to the fixture using attachments that place the detector-frame system 
such that they rotate along the center of mass. This will permit safer 
and easy rotation of the detector by hand. A gantry crane will be used 
to lift the detector onto and off the stringing fixture and to raise the 
small end of the detector  to account for the stereo angle.

The stringing fixture is very basic.  It is mounted to the floor using 
concrete anchors. This minimizes floor obstruction as the box must be 
rotated to the opposite side to string the second set of wires. The box 
and frame assembly should be far enough away from the uprights such that 
they do not interfere with stringing activities. There is sufficient 
adjustment to gravity string the wires. There is a gross adjustment using 
the gantry crane to lift the telescoping side and pin it on the adjustment 
collar.  The collar has a fine adjustment to zero in on the most 
favorable stringing angle. The detector box will be rotated 180 degrees 
to string the second super layer.

Once the detector is installed onto the fixture, wire feedthrough 
insulators will be inserted and glued into each hole. Special care must 
be taken to use only the minimal amount of glue required to provide a
solid gas seal and to prevent glue contamination inside the detector. Once 
one endplate is filled, the assembly will be rotated such that the other 
side can be done. Once all wire feedthrough inserts are in place, the box 
will be pre-tensioned.

\subsection{Mounting Electronics Boards}

The signal side of each chamber is tiled with multi-layer printed circuit 
boards called Signal Translation Boards (STBs).  These boards were designed to 
capacitively decouple high voltage from the signals, and then to route the 
signals to the single in-line package (SIP) transimpedance pre-amplifiers 
mounted on these boards.  The amplified differential signals are then sent 
via 20-m long twisted-pair lines to the main {\tt CLAS12} readout electronics.

The connections between the sense-wire crimp pins and the plated-through holes 
of the STB boards are made using short conductive-rubber tubes.  This material 
consists of silver-plated and/or nickel-plated glass spheres embedded in a 
silicon-rubber matrix.  These tubes pass through the plated-through hole and 
over the end of the crimp pins, making the electrical contract between the wire 
and the circuit board.  A small plastic cap inserted into the end of the tube 
ensures good contact with the circuit board.  This approach has the advantages 
of reducing the space needed for connections, preventing crimp pins from being 
pulled from the feedthroughs when disconnecting the boards from the wires, and 
reducing the cost compared to metal connectors.  This detail is shown in
Fig.~\ref{crimp}.

the crimp pin and inside the plated-through hole on the printed
circuit board to make the electrical connection.}}

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Positional Error Budget}

In order to achieve a position resolution of 250 \microns
the chambers have to be built accurately, positioned precisely
and carefully calibrated.   There are three main categories
of error: internal geometry, positioning accuracy and uncertainties
in the time to distance translation.
Table~\ref{errorbudget} lists the main contributors
to the error on the internal geometry or position of the wire relative
to fiducial marks on the endplates.  The quadratic sum of these
terms gives 130 \microns.
Errors in external surveys can
be compensated by ``straight-track'' alignment runs to the level of
60 \microns.  

Intrinsic resolutions due to random-walk in the
ion drift will be approximately 100 \microns times the square root
of the drift distance in centimeters; i.e. 90 - 150 \microns for 
Reg. 1 and Reg. 3.  This term has to be added to a variety of
``time-slewing'' effects due to amplifier rise-time and discrete
location of ions.  These time-slewing mechanisms mainly affect
the resolution near the wire and near the edge of the drift 
cell.  We see this clearly in our present data.  In an approximate
sense, this term has a size of about 150 \microns.
Adding the time-walk and time-slewing terms in quadrature gives
us about 200 \microns for the drift velocity dependent error.
A total quadratic sum of the internal positional error (130 \microns),
the external positioning error after alignment (60 \microns) and
the drift velocity dependent error (200 \microns) yields our
estimate of 250 \microns error per layer of measurement.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Quality Assurance}

The detector will be strung in a class-10,000 clean room to maintain 
clean wires and detector surfaces. Wire tensions will be monitored daily 
during the stringing process. All tension test results will be collected 
and saved in a database. All out of range wires will be replaced on a 
daily basis.  Each step completed during the stringing process will be 
independently checked at the end or beginning of each shift.

Once stringing is complete, wires will be checked for shorts and cross-talk 
prior to installing the HV boards. Wire tensions will be randomly tested and 
results compared to those previously determined. HV testing will be 
completed prior to installing the signal translator boards.


\section{Operation}

The chambers will operate for many years in a wide variety of experimental
conditions.  We will draw on the present {\tt CLAS} experience to supply gas and
power (low-voltage and high-voltage) to the chamber as needed, to monitor
these utility systems, and to provide shift-takers with an online determination
of various key tracking parameters: the number of hits used per track, the
online position resolution, the number of hits per layer and wire, the 
maximum drift time, and a plot of time differences for nearby wires which 
show characteristic peaks when coherent noise is present.  We will follow 
procedures similar to those described in our technical article~\cite{dcnim} 
on the {\tt CLAS} drift chambers.  We do not anticipate any changes in the
concepts for these operations.

\subsection{Alignment}

During {\tt CLAS} operation we have had numerous occasions to remove a chamber
in order to inspect or fix some problem.  After such a repair period, we
found it necessary to do a special ``$B$=0'' run in order to line up the 
removed and replaced chamber with the untouched chambers in the same sector.  
Our mechanical procedures allowed us to replace the chamber with millimeter 
accuracy; the alignment procedure fine-tuned our positional knowledge to an 
accuracy of better than 100~$\mu$m.

The {\tt CLAS12} chambers have a simpler and smaller geometry (planar chambers 
in a triangular box) and the positioning fixtures will be located closer 
together, thus we hope to replace a removed chamber with much better accuracy.
