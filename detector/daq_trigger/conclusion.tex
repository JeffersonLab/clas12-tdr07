\section{Conclusion}

Since the current {\tt CLAS} DAQ system already has a performance close 
to that needed for {\tt CLAS12}, we are confident that the {\tt CLAS12} 
goals will be achieved with available solutions.  All new components
designed by the JLab CODA group and the JLab Fast Electronics Group for Hall~D
will be utilized in {\tt CLAS12}, since the {\tt CLAS12} requirements have
already been taken into account.
