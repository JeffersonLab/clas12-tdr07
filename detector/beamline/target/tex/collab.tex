The University of Virginia Polarized Target Group is actively involved in this
project.
The group's contribution to the CLAS12 baseline equipment will be the
design, construction and testing of the longitudinal polarized target
discussed in this proposal. The target  will use a horizontal  $^{4}$He
evaporation refrigerator with a conventional design and similar to ones built
and operated in the past. The refrigerator will be constructed in the Physics
Department workshop; the workshop staff have experience with building such
devices. Testing will be done in the UVa lab where all the necessary
infrastructure is on hand. 
Two Research Professors (75\% of salary from UVA, 17\% from DOE), two Post-Docs
and two graduate students, all supported by DOE, will spend their time as
needed on this project. Other funding will be pursued as necessary.
Outside the base equipment considerations one member of the group (DGC) has started
working with Oxford Instruments on a design for an optimized transverse target
magnet to be used for transverse polarization measurements with CLAS12.
