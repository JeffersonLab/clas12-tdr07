\section{On-Line Software}

During the actual data-taking periods of CLAS12, it is of course expected that there will be full construction of a {\it significant} fraction of the acquired data. Such analysis insures that the data is of expected quality, and permits monitoring of the individual detectors from a different perspective than just hardware readout, such as wire profiles, adc spectra, etc. Experimenters should expect they should also be able to monitor the performance of the CLAS12 detector by examining the specific events and physics parameters under study. This capability will require {\it full} event reconstruction. 

In addition, some reconstruction analysis can be utilized as a {\it Level 3} trigger to filter unwanted events from the data stream, thus minimizing storage, bandwidth, and other precious resources.

The entire suite of services will be available to the on-line and data acquisition system, either directly as network available resources, or as shared code.
